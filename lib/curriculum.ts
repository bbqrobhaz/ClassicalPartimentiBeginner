The THREE BASIC CADENCES are: (1) SIMPLE CADENCE (Cadenza Semplice): dominant lasts ONE beat with a single sonority (5/3 or 7/3). (2) COMPOUND CADENCE (Cadenza Composta): dominant lasts TWO beats with two sonorities, often including a 4-3 suspension. (3) DOUBLE CADENCE (Cadenza Doppia): dominant lasts FOUR beats with four successive sonorities above V: 5/3 (or 7/3), 6/4, 5/4, and 5/3 (or 7/3).
